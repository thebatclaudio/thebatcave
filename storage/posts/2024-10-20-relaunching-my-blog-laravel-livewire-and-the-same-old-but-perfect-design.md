Here we go again. After years in the shadows, I’m bringing the blog back. Bigger. Stronger. Smarter.

This design? Yeah, it’s been here for years. Why? Because it’s flawless. You see those little **particles.js** dots floating around? They’re staying. Don’t like it? Too bad. I’ve redone this site more times than Gotham has crime. **AngularJS**. **Angular 2**. **Angular 4**. **Angular 6**. Each time, tweaking, perfecting. CSS? Done it. **LESS**? Handled it. **SCSS**? Nailed it. But now… now I’ve got something else in mind.

## Why keep fighting? Because I don’t know how to quit

I’ve been in this game a long time. Refactored this site more times than I can count. You’d think by now I’d stop. But you don’t stop when you’re the best at what you do. You evolve.

This time, I’ve rebuilt it all with **Laravel** and **Livewire**. It’s lean, it’s mean, and it’s ready for action. It’s not just about the tech — it’s about doing it right. **Tailwind CSS**? It’s like wearing a cape that actually helps me fly. No heavy frontend frameworks this time. Just **Laravel** and **Livewire**, working together like a well-oiled Batmobile. Fast, smooth, and deadly efficient. And yeah, **particles.js**? Still here, rising slowly, like distant stars drifting into the vast darkness.

## Why Laravel? Because it’s personal

This isn’t just about the latest tech trend. No. It’s personal. I’ve been using **PHP** since the beginning. It’s in my blood. And **Laravel**? It’s been with me for years. I started with **Laravel 4.1**. We’ve been through battles together. I’ve worked with other languages, sure. But PHP? It’s home. It’s the one constant in a world of changing frameworks and libraries.

So yeah, using Laravel and Livewire isn’t just some random choice. It’s sentimental. It’s like putting on that old, worn cape that’s saved your life a thousand times before. You don’t forget your roots. You embrace them.

## Markdown: my new utility belt

WordPress? Too bulky. Too slow. I don’t need it weighing me down. This time, I built my own package: **eloquent-markdown**. I’m writing all my posts in **Markdown**, saving them as files, and letting Laravel’s Eloquent handle the rest. Simple. Efficient. No frills, no nonsense. Just like a punch to the face.

Everything I write goes through this system now. It’s clean. It’s fast. It gets the job done. This blog is my creation, my city, and Markdown is just another tool in my arsenal.

## A fresh start (in english, because the world needs to hear this)

The past? Forget it. No more old posts. No more looking back. This blog is starting fresh. From now on, it’s all in **English**. Why? Because this is bigger than me. I’m sharing my experiments, my ideas, with the world. No more hiding in the dark.

Each post? A new mission. **This blog is where I test new tech**, where I push boundaries. Every month, I’m bringing something new. From how I built **eloquent-markdown** to optimizing Laravel and Livewire, this is where the action happens.

## What’s next?

Here’s what’s coming up:

- **Why Laravel and Livewire are the heroes this site deserves**.
- **Building Eloquent Markdown**: How I created a lightweight blog system using Markdown files.
- **The long road from AngularJS to Laravel**: Why it took so many refactors, and why this time I’m not looking back.

This isn’t just a blog. It’s a statement. **Laravel**, **Livewire**, **Tailwind**, and my trusty sidekick, **particles.js** — they’re all here for the ride. I’ve been at this a long time, but I’m just getting started.

Got questions? Want to know how I did it? Leave a comment. Or don’t. I’ll be watching anyway.
